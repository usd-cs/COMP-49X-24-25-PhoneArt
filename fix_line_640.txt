# Slider Consistency Implementation

## Objective
Standardize all sliders across the app to match the current implementation in PropertiesPanel, and add "info" (i) buttons to all sliders providing tooltips with helpful descriptions.

## Required Changes

1. **Make all sliders visually consistent**:
   - Update sliders in ColorPropertiesPanel.swift and ColorSelectionPanel.swift to match the style and dimensions of those in PropertiesPanel.swift
   - Ensure consistent spacing and padding around all sliders
   - Standardize the appearance of text input fields associated with sliders

2. **Add info buttons with tooltips to all sliders**:
   - Implement the tooltip system from PropertiesPanel for all sliders in ColorPropertiesPanel and ColorSelectionPanel
   - Add information (i) buttons next to each slider label
   - Create appropriate tooltip descriptions for each slider's functionality

3. **Create tooltip content**:
   - For Hue slider: "Adjusts the overall color tone of rainbow-generated patterns."
   - For Saturation slider: "Controls the intensity or vividness of colors in the artwork."
   - For Alpha slider: "Adjusts the transparency level of the shapes in your artwork."
   - For Stroke Width slider: "Sets the thickness of the outline around shapes."
   - For Preset Count slider: "Determines how many color preset slots are visible for selection."

4. **Implement TooltipView consistently**:
   - Ensure the same TooltipView implementation is used across all panels
   - Make sure tooltips have consistent styling, positioning, and animation

## Implementation Notes
- Use the existing tooltip system from PropertiesPanel as the reference implementation
- The tooltips should appear when the info button is pressed and disappear when clicked outside
- Each tooltip should clearly describe the function of its associated slider
- Maintain accessibility identifiers for all UI elements
